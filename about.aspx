    <h4>We are family owned and operated.  No middle men, no funny business.</h4>
    <h4>Quality cars?</h4> 
    We get our vehicles the same way all dealers do. 
    We buy from lease and rental companies, lenders, other dealers, private sellers and we take trade-ins. 
    We only buy the ones that we would own and drive ourselves. 
    We clean, service and recondition them the way we would want them to be if we were in your shoes. 
    We know that it’s “new to you” and we want to make it that way.
